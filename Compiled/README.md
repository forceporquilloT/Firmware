This folder contains compiled OpenGarage firmware files.

To use OTA (over-the-air) update:

* Download the firmware file (in .bin format)

* Before uploading, close the Blynk and OpenGarage app if 
  you use either of them, to avoid them interfering with
  the upload process.
  
* On your OpenGarage's web interface, click 'Update' at 
  the bottom of the homepage. Select the firmware file,
  type in device key, and 'Submit'. Wait till it finishes.
  
* If the upload fails for any reason, you can try again.
  If the device hangs, unplug and plug back power and
  try again.
  
* If the firmware upload is corrupted for any reason,
  causing the device to fail to boot, you will need to
  re-upload the firmware using a microUSB cable. See
  README.md at the root folder for instructions.
